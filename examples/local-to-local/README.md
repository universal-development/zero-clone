# Local-to-local example

This example shows end-to-end syncing from local source directories into the local `clone/` directory using zero-clone and rclone.

Layout
- `source/alpha`, `source/beta`: precreated sample source dirs with files and subdirectories
- `.zero-clone/`: config folder used by zero-clone
  - `rclone.conf`: present (empty is fine for local copies)
  - `env.sh`: per-base settings like `JOBS`
  - `list.txt`: generated by `run.sh` with absolute paths

Run
- From repository root or any directory:
  - `bash examples/local-to-local/run.sh`
- The script will:
  - generate `.zero-clone/list.txt` with absolute paths to the precreated sources
  - invoke `bin/zero-clone --yes <this-example-base>`

After running
- Synced files will be in `clone/`:
  - `clone/a/file1.txt`
  - `clone/beta/file2.txt`
- Logs in `.zero-clone/logs/`.
